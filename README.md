# Loan Credit Evaluation
The purpose of this repository was to practice ensemble and Resampling techniques to classify the loan status of potential borrowers as "high-risk", or "low-risk".

We use Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, Cluster Centroid undersampling, and SMOTEEN combination sampling to make predictions on lending data.

We then use ensemble techniques (Balanced Random Forest and Easy Ensemble) to make predictions on Loan Data from Q1 2019, and we use the feature importance method from the BRF to determine the most important features when it comes to determining loan status.
